2013-10-01 v0.7.0.6
	* Sort out most of the do/in/let layout when renaming. Only nested
	layout changes to be dealt with.
	* Updated to use the latest ghc-mod, with cabal 1.18.x sandbox
	support.
	* Updated to latest versions of Diff and hspec
	* When refactoring a CPP pre-processed file, read the preprocessor
	directives and non-compiled code as comments, so the source can be
	round-tripped. This allows refactoring of simple #if/#else/#endif
	code. NOTE: no refactoring is done on code that is not live after
	the preprocessor.
2013-09-12  v0.7.0.5
	* Now able to get tokens for a file pre-processed with CPP. But it
	is the pre-processed output, so the CPP directives are stripped
	out when writing out the refactored source.
